# Social Experience Enhancements

## Current Foundation
- The social module already maintains collaborative lists, watch party scheduling, and shared review data for friends, giving us a baseline for richer community tools.
- Presence polling, badge tracking, and community review forms are built into the client, so we can extend what already feels familiar to returning users.

## Opportunities to Expand the Experience

### 1. Smarter Friend Discovery and Onboarding
- Layer in "People you may know" suggestions that look at mutual followers, overlapping watch histories, or favorite genres to make the follow graph grow organically.
- Encourage profile sharing with customizable vanity links and QR codes so in-person events can translate into in-app connections quickly.
- Add optional contact syncing or invite links that pre-fill follow requests, respecting privacy by keeping everything opt-in.

### 2. Deeper Conversations Around Reviews
- Let people start threaded replies under community notes, with lightweight markdown and spoiler tags so longer-form reviews stay readable.
- Surface highlight reels ("Top friend's takeaway", "Most surprising review") that summarize sentiment from someone you follow versus the wider community.
- Expand emoji reactions into full reaction analytics so users can see how their friends responded emotionally to a film night.

### 3. Premium Watch Party Moments
- Extend watch parties with synchronized countdowns, shared scene reactions, and an ambient chat room that persists afterward for recap notes.
- Offer co-host roles so one friend can handle moderation while another curates trivia, polls, or mini-games during the party.
- Capture party highlights (top quotes, collective rating, playlists) that automatically post back into each attendee's profile feed.

### 4. Social Progression and Recognition
- Turn badges into tiered achievements with clear progress bars (e.g., "Critic in Training" → "Master Curator") so players know what to do next.
- Introduce seasonal spotlights or community quests ("Review three debuts this month") that unlock exclusive profile frames or emoji packs.
- Add gratitude mechanics where friends can endorse each other for specific skills (taste matching, event hosting), showcasing social capital.

### 5. Collaborative Storytelling Beyond Lists
- Evolve collaborative lists into "collections" that support rich text intros, embedded trailers, and voting mechanisms for what to watch next.
- Give groups a shared activity log that chronicles edits, newly added picks, and milestones ("Completed a trilogy together"), making collaboration feel alive.
- Allow exported collections to become public showcases other teams can fork, remix, or subscribe to for inspiration.

### 6. Presence, Notifications, and Boundaries
- Add status presets ("Available for watch party", "In the mood for comedies") that automatically update recommendation biases when friends browse together.
- Layer in quiet hours, digest emails, and granular notification preferences so social chatter stays delightful instead of overwhelming.
- When friends go live in a party or start a new review thread, deliver real-time toasts with quick-action buttons (join, react, save for later).

### 7. Extend the Social Graph Across Platforms
- Ship a share-target integration so mobile users can send a title from any streaming app directly into Smart Movie Match with a comment for friends.
- Explore optional push notifications via the PWA install, ensuring badge wins or party invites reach people even when the site is closed.
- Provide an API for third-party bots (Discord, Slack) to broadcast watch parties or community highlights into existing friend hubs.
